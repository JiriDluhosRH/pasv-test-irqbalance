# pasv-test-irqbalance
A passive test for basic irqbalance functionality.

This test is meant for fast, unintrusive testing of the basic functioning of the "irqbalance" tool. It is passive, meant that it does not disrupt the system in any way, it only runs harmless commands, the effect on CPU and memory is negligible (hopefully), and can be run on the side with another tests (very useful if the deadline is creeping close and the whole QE team is fighting for a few eligible machines :) )
